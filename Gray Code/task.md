# [Gray Code](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2205)

A Gray code is a list of all $2^n$ bit strings of length $n$, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one).

Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length $n$.

## Input

The only input has an integer $n$.

## Output

Print $2^n$ lines that describe the Gray code. You can print aly valid solution.

## Constraints

* $1 \le \le 16$

## Example

**Input:**

`2`

**Output:**

```
00
01
11
